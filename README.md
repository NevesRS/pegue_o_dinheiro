<h1>ALEST II Project</h1>
The objective of this project was to read a TXT file, and at the end of it, the accumulated value during the path should be indicated. This file had a map format with characters indicating the movement. To solve the challenge, I used a conversion logic translating the txt file into a matrix (`construtor_matriz.js`), allowing complete navigation of the map in terms of rows and columns (`app.js`).

<h2>Running the Application</h2>

The value is described within the `casos` folder, the program concatenates only the number to the file path.
